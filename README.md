## Welcome to my Github!
My name is Tom, and I am interested in data science. I want to combine my biology/research background with machine learning and/or
artificial intelligence.

My goals are:

- To implement flowSOM unsupervised clustering to flow cytometric data (natively in R/Rmd).
- To be proficient with Python/Jupyter and complete Kaggle projects.

Fun fact: even though I have caffeine intolerance and cannot drink coffee, I am a certified barista!
