# Welcome to my Github!
My name is Tom, and I want to combine my biology/research background with machine learning and/or
artificial intelligence.

My data science learning goals are:

- To implement flowSOM unsupervised clustering to flow cytometric data (natively in R/Rmd).
- To be proficient with Python/Jupyter and complete Kaggle projects.

For more details on my professional and educational backgrounds, here's my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tompham97/).

Fun fact: even though I have caffeine intolerance and cannot drink coffee, I am a certified barista!
